# Permutation Generator

This is an app based on the original permutation computer program designed by Ian Sommerville
which was used to create Brion Gysin's 'Permutation Poems'

It will generate all possible combinations of up to six words using Python's itertools module

# Desktop Version

The standalone desktop version has a GUI made using PyQt5 and is also included as a 
Windows executable (located in /static/).
This version also has an option to number the output permutations.

# Web App Version:

The web app version uses HTML5 and Flask for its interface.

A working example of this code can be seen at: http://www.jimimcdonald.co.uk/permutations/
